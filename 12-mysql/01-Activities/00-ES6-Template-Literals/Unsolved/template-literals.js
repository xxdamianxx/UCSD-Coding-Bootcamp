const animal = "fox";
const speed = "quick";


// Using a template literal a print a string to console like this:

// The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

// but make sure you use the animal and speed variables instead of just writing the word fox and quick

const thanos = {
    name: "Thanos",
    color: "purple",
    snap: function(num) {
        return num / 2;
    }
}

// Now write a string like this using the thanos object

// Even though Thanos is purple he can still snap half the universe away

// Make sure to use that Thanos object to get his name and his color

// Try to get the return of thano's snap method in a template literal (YOU CAN DO IT!)

// Try to get a string that looks like this:
// Thanos just snapped a 10 into a 5 
// The 5 should be from the call to thano's snap method.
