 ### Implement Selection Sort (25 min)

 **Instructions**:

  * Using the below approach as a guide, implement the "Selection Sort" in JavaScript.

    1. Scan through the list and find the smallest number possible. This requires looping through and checking which number is greater than 0, but smaller than all other numbers.
    2. We would then say that this is our first number.
    3. We would then loop through and check which number is bigger than this smallest number, but smaller than any other number.
    4. This would then be our second number.
    5. And so on...

* Then, test your algorithm with each of the commented out arrays of data. As a bonus, use Benchmark.js to time it in both cases.
