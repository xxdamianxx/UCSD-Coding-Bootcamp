### Pseudocode Quick-Sort (20 min.)

**Instruction**:

* Write a (pseudocode!) implementation of quick-sort. You can assume that `partition` and `select_pivot` functions are already written for you.

* Keep in mind the idea of recursion: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursive_functions_and_algorithms>

* Don't sweat it if you're unsure of your solutionâ€”pseudocode affords a lot of freedom, and we'll review things together shortly. Regardless, be prepared to explain your work!
